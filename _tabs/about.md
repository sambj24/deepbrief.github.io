# About Deep Brief

**Deep Brief** delivers a sharp, no-fluff perspective on the intersection of engineering, leadership, real-world decision making, and my hobby - diving. Itâ€™s for professionals who value experience but know the game is changing fast.

Created by [Joe Sambuco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsambuco), an executive in tech with a hands-on approach to both engineering and strategy. This blog is where firsthand lessons meet hard analysis, without buzzwords or bull.
