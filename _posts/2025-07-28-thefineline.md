**Customer-first.**  
**Patient-centered.**  
**Human-led digital transformation.**

These phrases are everywhere, but they’re becoming meaningless. Across industries, organizations are cutting corners under the banner of innovation. AI, automation, sensors, and bots are being rolled out like silver bullets. And in the process, they’re bulldozing the very thing that made good companies great: the human experience.

Let’s not romanticize the past. Tools evolve. But we’ve confused enhancement with elimination. And the cracks are everywhere, from healthcare and insurance to hospitality and mortgages.

## From Hammer to Nail Gun: The Right Way to Use Tech

Think of a carpenter. The hammer was essential for decades, until the nail gun arrived. But smart carpenters didn’t toss out their skills. They didn’t stop checking for alignment or caring about the grain of the wood. They used the nail gun to do more faster, without sacrificing quality or judgment. That’s how AI should work. It should empower the craftsman, not replace the craft.

But that’s not what’s happening.

## GEICO vs. Liberty Mutual: Efficiency vs. Experience

GEICO has long leaned into digital convenience, but it pairs automation with responsive human support. You can self-service 80% of what you need, but a capable rep is there when things get complicated.

Liberty Mutual, on the other hand, has over-rotated on automation. Customers often get caught in endless chatbot loops or face delays during claims processes. AI filters, scripting, and digital walls frustrate users trying to solve real problems. They’ve given the nail gun to someone who never learned how to build.

## Disney: Magic Lost in the Algorithm

Disney used to be the benchmark of hospitality. Cast members were trained to observe, personalize, and make guests feel special. Now? Genie+ and Lightning Lane have made visits feel like military ops. Visitors manage itineraries through apps, glued to schedules instead of soaking in magic.

Disney still has the best "tools," but it forgot how to wield them. It’s like giving a world-class orchestra auto-tune software and telling them to lip-sync.

## Healthcare: Sensors Don’t Feel, Bots Don’t Heal

Hospitals have adopted AI and sensor-based tech to track vitals, assign care paths, and monitor patients. But many are using this as a way to cut nursing staff, not support them.

At major systems like Ascension and Sutter Health, experienced RNs are being replaced with tech-enabled LPNs or remote monitoring stations. The results? Missed symptoms, lower morale, and patients who feel like data points, not people.

Healthcare isn’t a factory. You can’t swap a nurse with a sensor any more than you’d replace a flight attendant with a coffee machine. The best hospitals, like Cleveland Clinic, know this. They use AI to enhance diagnostics and scheduling but double down on bedside care and personalized attention.

## Freedom Mortgage vs. Mutual of Omaha: When Relationships Matter

Freedom Mortgage has digitized almost everything, until you need help. Customers describe being passed between automated systems and overseas agents, often during emotionally charged moments like closing delays or loan modifications.

Mutual of Omaha, by contrast, uses technology to simplify, but not sterilize, the process. You still get a named advisor. You still feel like a person, not a file number. That’s the difference between using AI like a nail gun, and just firing nails blindly.

## Other Industry Analogies That Matter

**Pilots and Autopilot**: Autopilot doesn’t replace pilots. It lets them focus on judgment, safety, and human decisions. You don’t want a plane that only flies itself. You want one where a skilled human knows when to step in.

**Music and Production Software**: Tools like Ableton and Pro Tools made music more accessible, but artists still bring soul, timing, and creative instinct. You can’t auto-generate a hit. You enhance the performance.

**Restaurants and Self-Service Kiosks**: Ordering from a screen is fine, until your allergy order gets botched. That’s when a human who listens, double-checks, and cares becomes the hero of the story.

In all these examples, technology scales skill. It doesn’t replace it.

## The Permal Touch: What We’re Losing

The “permal touch” is that invisible thread that turns transactions into trust:

* The nurse who checks in unprompted because she remembers your last bloodwork.
* The hotel front desk who upgrades you because they saw your flight delay.
* The mortgage advisor who calls just to say, “We’re still on track.”

These are small things. But they stick. They’re permanent. They’re the moments your AI can’t fake, and your competitors can’t steal.

## How to Get It Back

### Let AI Handle the Mundane, Not the Meaningful

Offload logistics. But leave relationships, judgment, and emotion to humans who are trained to care.

### Treat Human Roles as Strategic Assets, Not Cost Centers

Nurses, reps, concierges, and advisors build brand equity in ways your dashboards never will. Pay them well. Train them better.

### Audit the Experience You’re Actually Delivering

Walk through your customer or patient journey. Where are the “I feel seen” moments? If they’re missing, you have a bigger problem than throughput.

### Stop Replacing Talent with Tech Because You Can

Just because you can automate something doesn’t mean you should. Keep the human touch where it creates outsized emotional return.

## Final Word: Tools Don't Build Trust, People Do

There’s a fine line between amplification and abandonment. AI, when used well, is like giving your best employees superpowers. But when used to cut corners, it turns craftsmanship into commodity, and your brand becomes forgettable.

Whether you’re in healthcare, insurance, finance, or hospitality, remember this:
Your bots may process faster, but only your people leave a lasting impression.

Want to strike the right balance between automation and experience? Let's build a strategy where your tools support your talent, not replace it!

Happy Innovation. Joe Sambuco
